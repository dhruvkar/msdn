#MSDN Automation

This project is meant to automate administering licenses on Microsoft's [MSDN site](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/).


 **Currently this is highly experimental/fragile, not ready for production use!**
 **Make sure Selenium and PhantomJS are installed and PhantomJS is in the PATH.**


Can be used by running `python quickstart.py`
